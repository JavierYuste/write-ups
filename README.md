# Write-ups
A collection of some write-ups or walkthroughs on challenges about reversing. They are not of high quality and the challenges are not complex at all. I am doing these walkthroughs as a way of forcing myself to dig deeper into those challenges in order to be able to explain them to beginners. Hence, the purpose of these writes is to solidify the knowledge acquired while resolving the challenges exposed. Please feel free to pm me if you find anything either wrong or improvable. If some of these content helps you in any way, give back some feedback, it will be much appreciated.
